## Description

Using the SGG library, we created a film library app called "MovieBox".
The app contains a "Who's Watching?" screen with 3 user options, a home screen, a browse screen and an info screen.

The home screen contains a slideshow to showcase 4 movies and a selcetion of 5 popular movies and 5 new releases.
The browse screen offers movie filtering by release year and genre, as well as a searchbar for titles, actors and directors.
When a movie is selected from either screens a movie screen appeares with additional information and pictures.

The widgets and the screens are created in the `widgets.h` file and the functionality of the app can be found in the file `gui.cpp`.

More information on building the SGG library inorder to run this project can be found [here](https://cgaueb.github.io/sgg/index.html).
The application has been tested and works both on UNIX-based and Windows systems.
